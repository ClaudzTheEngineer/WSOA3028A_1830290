            Color Scheme
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Proposed main color scheme for the website, this was chosen due to the clean aesthetic which it could
            provide with the light and dark greys, with the bright orange accent. The cleanliness would originate from
            the Giovanni's military background, where being tidy is of the upmost importance, while the orange would be
            to capture the readers attention.

        <h3>
            Data structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            The final website will consist of some form of database-esque storage system, into which all the various
            blog posts will be stored. Then a singular blog template page is stored and then backfilled using
            information from the database. This is appropriate from the perspective of Giovanni being skilled with
            backend development and would feel comfortable with this style of data manipulation.

            The Character - Giovanni Suzzi
        </h3>
        <p>
            This character is meant to be an amalgamation of my father and my grandfather. Combining the military
            aspects of the former and the engineering industriousness of the latter, as well as some elements of their
            lives. The history of the character is in the <a href=about/me.html>about</a> page
