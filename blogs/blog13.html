            With the country’s move to lockdown level 2, Suzzi Ltd Inc. has decided to open its doors again. However due
            to the nature of this level of lockdown we have had to change certain things around the workplace.
            <br><br>
            To facilitate social distancing we are not having all of our staff members return to the office. Those that
            are going back are those who feel that they are not at as much risk (younger and have no former medical
            conditions) as well as those who feel they are struggling to work at home.
            <br><br>
            However business will not be as usual, rotational hours will be implemented to minimise the amount of people
            in the office at any one time, meetings will still be hosted online and all staff are expected to withhold
            the highest santitation procedures.
            <br><br>
            To assist with the sanitation of the workplace, a more advanced cleaning crew has been hired to supplement
            our current cleaning service. Thus we will make sure all surfaces will be sterilised.
            <br><br>
            With regards to our staff, we are willing to pay for tests for them and their families to assist those who
            may not be able to afford it. However we will still maintain screening when the staff arrives at work.
            <br><br>
            During the period where no one was at the office we managed to contribute a large amount of processing power
            to the Folding@home initiative. However, due to part of the company having to return to work, we will
            have to reclaim some of the PC’s. We will keep as many up and running as possible as such we should only
            lose 20% of the processing power.
            <br><br>
            On a more personal note, I have been looking into a grocery run share app. This could allow for a community
            to more readily help those in need of groceries without putting each other at risk. The app would basically
            work by you requesting certain goods, and someone who happens to be going to a shop can accept your
            request, then they could drive past your house and drop off the goods you needed before going home. However
            more research will need to go into the feasibility of this app. The app is aimed mostly at health workers
            and the elderly but I need to hurry up and make it because pretty soon I'll be part of the elderly club.
            <br><br>
            To everyone else at home, from us at Suzzi we wish you safety for you and your loved ones.
            <br><br>
