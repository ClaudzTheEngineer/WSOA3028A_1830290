            “As we may think”, was an essay written in 1945 by Vannevar Bush in which he speculated about the aspects of
            life in an information society. One of the most influential visions he had was of the memex and its use in
            storing information for ease of access, among some other some other ideas.
        </p>
        <h2>Vannevar Bush</h2>
        <p>
            Vannevar Bush was an American engineer who headed the office of the U.S. Scientific Research and Development
            which carried out the research for, among other things, the Manhattan project.
        </p>
        <h2>The MEMEX</h2>
        <p>
            Not to be confused with a meme for people from generation ‘X’, the “memex” was a thought of to be a device
            into which a person could compress and store all their books, records and other information. This
            information would be stored on microtape and then subsequently projected, so that the storage would remain
            small and compact. Users could record associative links between articles which could then be shared. This
            idea of the associative link is credited as the inspiration for the hypertext system created in the 1960’s.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Today’s MEMEX
        </h2>
        <p>
            The system’s memory is very reminiscent of resources like Wikipedia, in which hyperlinks allow readers to
            find associated articles or do deep dives on certain topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The window on the top of the system that would allow for the user to input longhand notes, photos or
            articles into the photographic memory is reminiscent of flatbed scanners.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all the inventions thought of by Vannevar in this essay are wonderfully archaic in their design, but
            beautifully futuristic in their function, it allows us to wonder what technology will be like in another 50
            years.
