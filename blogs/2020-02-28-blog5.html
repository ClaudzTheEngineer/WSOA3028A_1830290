            The Latin origin word, meta, is used to describe something that is self-referential, and data is a discrete
            piece of information. Combine these definitions and you get self-referential information, or information
            about information.

        <p>
            In a computing context, meta-tags and meta-data is the information that a webpage stores about the
            information stored within the page. These can include, but are in no way limited to, the character set used
            by the page, instructions for bots, the owner and various other information the user will not normally see.
        </p>
        <h2>Are they anywhere else?</h2>
        <p>

            Meta-tags are used elsewhere in the computing world, not just for websites. A trivial example being digital
            photos, contained within the data are meta-tags that store the aperture, focal length, what white balance
            was used, what ISO, exposure time, location data and more.

        <h2>Null Island</h2>
        <p>
            A funny occurrence that happens due to poorly designed software, is the seemly existent “null island” at
            0°N, 0°E in the Gulf of Guinea. Large amounts of photos seem to have been taken at this place as some
            software would enter (0,0) into the geolocation metatag erroneously
