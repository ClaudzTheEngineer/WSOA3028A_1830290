            Interactivity as defined by the Oxford dictionary is "Any communication between two or more individuals that
            is dynamically shaped by the participants of the exchange", however in relation to computers and the web at
            large, interactivity refers more to the dialog that is exchanged between a user (human) and a computer. The
            range of interactivity a program can have is vast, from the high end with video games, down to the low end
            with business applications.<br>

        <h2>Web Design</h2>
        <p>
            Interactivity is a very important element in web-design (without it websites would not work). However,
            elevated amounts of it can make the user-experience better and more engaging, encouraging uses to not only
            stay longer but return later.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Gamification
        </h2>
        <p>
            Interactivity allows for the user to be more engaged with the task they have at hand. This can clearly seen
            in the addictive nature of video games and the dopamine kicks they give, however the principles that keep
            people glued to their games are being used in other fields aswell.<br>
            In recent years, companies have realised that the use of game techniques in their non-game applications and
            marketing
            can be a powerful tool. By implementing features that promote interactivity (such as point scoring, leveling
            systems etc) user engagement with the product increases. Companies such as the Botswana Insurance Company
            are utilising a mobile game focused on businesses to promote both their products and better spending
            habits.<br>
            These practices could be used in more predatory contexts to create damaging habits through the use of
            Skinner boxes and similar. A skinner box (or Operant conditioning chamber) is a device that conditions a
            user to do repeated actions on a schedule to recieve some form of reward. By conditioning a user, these
            users could be abused in a similar vein to how some
            mobile app developers prey on those with poor gambling habits or impatience with microtransactions.<br>
