        <p>
            Semantics is relating to meaning in language or logic. Semantic markup extends on this idea, by allocating
            meaning to the various tags used in a markup language such as HTML. Although visually, a lot of tags seem
            similar or will have the similar properties, on a lower level they are different.
        </p>
        <h2>So what?</h2>
        <p>Primarily these specialised tags are for bots or programs that assist people (like screen readers). It
            allows for them to understand what various parts of a webpage are and use the information accordingly. It
            helps make webpages that both humans and machines can read more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            A common example is the tags “div” and “span”, these tags are effectively default templates for formatting,
            however, it does not say anything about the contents contained therein. So better tags to use would be like
            “article” or “header” (provided it was appropriate).
