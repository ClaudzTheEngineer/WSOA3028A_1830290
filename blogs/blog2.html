            Just over 50 years ago, on October 29th, 1969, the very first message was sent across the internet’s
            precursor, ARPANET. You’d think that such a historic moment in the creation of the internet would yield a
            profound and thought-provoking greeting, however you’d be disappointed. The first message was intended to be
            “login” however, the entire system crashed after the ‘o’ was sent.
        </p>
        <h2>
            ARPANET?
        </h2>
        <p>
            ARPANET was the first system to utilise technologies that would be foundational to the internet as we know
            it (such as the TCP/IP protocol). The project was created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US
            department of defence, with one of its initial purposes for meeting the needs of the militaries control of
            nuclear threats (the cold war was still in full swing at the time).
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial network consisted of only 4 links, between 3 universities and 1 research institute. And from
            these small stepping stones, the internet was born.
