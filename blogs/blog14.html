            For my website I wanted to integrate an interactable map showing my travels around the world with regards to
            my childhood, early life, military adventures as well as my later life. So I thought the best way to achieve
            this would be through the usage of the Google Maps API.
            <br><br>
            Regarding the options, the main ones I had looked at was "Google Maps", "Open layers", and "HERE". Although
            "Open layers" is free, it lacked the features I wanted for the mapping of my life, only providing markers,
            thus ruling it out. I then looked at "HERE" and "Google Maps", both have paid services at a certain point.
            However Google maps provided an easy to use online map creator for embedding which made it win for me. It
            took less time and effort to create the map required, combined with the fact that Google Maps is used by
            more people.
            <br><br>
            The original plan was to use the KML/KMZ file format to store all the points I wanted to portray on the map,
            and then utilising the google maps API I would generate the map at runtime using javascript. However, this
            was unfeasible to do as a service I had initially interpreted as free had various conditions. The usage of
            Google’s “My Maps” service is free, and so is embedding. The usage of their API however is not, and the
            price varies on the amount of people passing through your site and the inclusion of a credit card being tied
            to your account. This I did not feel comfortable doing, and as such decided to go with the less impressive
            route of embedding the map in my ‘About’ page.
            <br><br>
            The choice to go with a Maps API at all,instead of justing using images and a list, is mainly driven by
            interactivity
            I can scribble all over a static image, but its not interactive. A user cannot
            zoom in and pan about and see whats nearby that’s relevant to them. The points of interest are also not a
            constant distance apart, where some are roughly 2km apart, and others 12000km apart.Thus zooming and
            panning is a necessity.
            <br><br>
            In my family it is a rare occurance for all 3 of us to be in a photo together (as someone has to hold the
            camera). However, on my one visit back to Italy to visit my parents, we saw one of the Google Maps street
            view cars driving past. So somewhere on Google maps we will be immortalised as one of the few photos of my
            whole family. It was a silly moment but it was special for me and my family.
