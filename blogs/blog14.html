            For my website I wanted to integrate an interactable map showing my travels around the world with regards to
            my childhood, early life, military adventures as well as my later life. So I thought the best way to achieve
            this would be through the usage of the Google Maps API.
            <br><br>
            The original plan was to use the KML/KMZ file format to store all the points I wanted to portray on the map,
            and then utilising the google maps API I would generate the map at runtime using javascript. However, this
            was unfeasible to do as a service I had initially interpreted as free had various conditions. The usage of
            Google’s “My Maps” service is free, and so is embedding. The usage of their API however is not, and the
            price varies on the amount of people passing through your site and the inclusion of a credit card being tied
            to your account. This I did not feel comfortable doing, and as such decided to go with the less impressive
            route of embedding the map in my ‘About’ page.
            <br><br>
            Now the choice to go with a Maps API at all instead of just using images and a list. That is mainly driven
            by interactivity. Because I can scribble all over a static image, but its not interactable, a user cannot
            zoom in and pan about and see whats nearby that’s relevant to them. The points of interest are also not a
            constant distance apart, where some are roughly 2km apart, and others 12000km apart, meaning zooming and
            panning is a necessity.
            <br><br>
            In my family it is a rare occurance for all 3 of us to be in a photo together (as someone has to hold the
            camera). However, on my one visit back to Italy to visit my parents, we saw one of the Google Maps street
            view cars driving past. So somewhere on Google maps we will be immortalised as one of the few photos of my
            whole family. It was a silly moment but it was special for me and my family.
