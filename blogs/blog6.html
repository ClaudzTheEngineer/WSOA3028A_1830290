            Alternative Communication Ideas - Speculation
        </h1>

        <p>
            With the current pandemic universities are being urged to close down, however there are a
            significant amount
            of students that cannot access online classes due to lack of internet. This allows for one to
            speculate
            about alternative methods for communicating over long distance.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Problem 1: Data
        </h2>

        <p>
            As nice as 1080p60 video lectures are, they absolutely chew through bandwidth. Each individual
            stream using
            12Mbps. For semi-apocalyptic situations this could prove devastating to try and maintain.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Problem 2: Internet
        </h2>

        <p>
            Having tiny files is great, but with people that have no internet it would defeat the purpose.
            Although some
            form of communication infrastructure does need to be inplace.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Solution 1: HF radio
        </h2>

        <p>
            A potential solution would be the usage of various long range radio broadcasts. Depending on the
            assumed
            technology people could have access to, if people have a laptop and software definded radio, people
            can use
            WinLink (or something similar). Which would allow for email and file transfer over HF radio.
            However, the
            data speeds are nothing to be impressed at, at 75 to 9600 bits its not breaking any records, so tiny
            files
            is a must. Using plaintext would be necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Solution 2: Telephone + Recording software.
        </h2>

        <p>
            Utilising telecommunications infrastructure, the university could deploy a system to have vocal data
            containing voice recordings of lectures broadcast through conference calls, that software on a phone
            could
            then decompress. (Otherwise the phone call would be as long as the lecture). This would allow for
            podcasts
            to be sent.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Solution 3: Dial-Up internet or a similar system.
        </h2>

        <p>
            Using updated technology from the 80’s we could make a system to use phone systems to provide crude
            internet
            access. If the system was more automated and instead of waiting for a user to browse for what they
            need,
            having the system automatically grab and dump the files on the system and disconnect would help with
            limiting bandwidth usage. Assuming the same speed of dail up, 56 kbit/s, a pdf of 1-5MB would take
            11
            minutes. However using a system similar to latex where the data is plaintext would allow for far
            shorter
            times, in the range of seconds.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Solution 4: Slow scan television
        </h2>

        <p>
            For images that need to be transferred, using cold-war era technology could prove useful. As it
            would allow
            higher resolution images to be carried while keeping bandwidth usage low, as it is possible to get
            away with
            as little as 3kHz, so pushing up to more commercial bands (in the mega or even gigahertz range)
            would allow
            far larger images at faster transfer speeds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Software could maintain the transmission times, perhaps a catalog for the day’s transmissions would
            be sent
            out using one of the previous methods. Then if a student needs a specific file, the system would
            tune in at
            the same time to retrieve the information and generate the image.
