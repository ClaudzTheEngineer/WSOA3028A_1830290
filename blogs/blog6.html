            During the current pandemic, as you may know, a nationwide lock-down has been enacted. As such, all
            businesses that are not considered critical have been forced to close their doors. We here at Suzzi LTD,
            have decided to self-isolate to assist in the prevention of the covid-19 spread. However, we will continue
            work in an online capacity to maintain deadlines with our clients. Workplace deployments will not be
            possible until such time as the lockdown has been reduced after May 1st.
            <br><br>
            To assist in this transition, I have allowed various staff (in the office) to take their desktop
            workstations home with them so that they can continue to work at home. Luckily, most of my staff have good
            internet connections, however, one of my staff members relies on a fixed data package (which can be
            unreliable at times). To help with this I went through the office networking supplies and retrieved a
            long-range wireless bridge we had used for an offsite project a few years ago. Using this, I established an
            internet connection from her house to the office so that she may piggyback off the officeâ€™s business
            internet (Lucky her!).
            <br><br>
            To assist in combatting the virus globally, I have entered the workplace into the Folding@Home initiative.
            This way we can help contribute to the research for COVID-19 by (letting them use your PCs processing
            power). I signed up all the remaining workstations in the office, including the ones I pulled out of
            storage. This means about 256 threads of raw performance. These workstations will be permanently computing
            for Folding@Home until we are able to return to the office.
            <br><br>
            To our readers, and to their loved ones - we wish you safety
            <br><br>
