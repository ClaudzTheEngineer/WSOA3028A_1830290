            During the current pandemic, as you may know, a nationwide lock-down has been enacted. As such all
            businesses that are not considered critical have been forced to close their doors. We here at Suzzi LTD have
            decided to self-isolate to assist in the prevention of spreading the virus. However, we will resume work in
            an online capacity to maintain deadlines with our clients. We will be unable to do workplace deployments
            until such time as the lockdown has been reduced after May 1st.
            <br><br>
            To assist in this transition, I have allowed various staff in the office to take their desktop workstations
            from the office to use at home if necessary. Luckily most of my staff have good internet connections,
            however, my one staff member does not have one, relying on a fixed data package. To help with this I went
            through the office networking supplies and retrieved a long-range wireless bridge we had used for an offsite
            project a few years ago. Using this I established a internet connection from their house to the office so
            that they may piggyback off the officeâ€™s business internet (Lucky her!).
            <br><br>
            To assist in combatting the virus globally, I have entered the workplace into the Folding@Home initiative.
            This way we can help contribute to the research for COVID-19. To do this I pulled out all the workstation
            PCs out of storage and the remaining workstations to be permanently be computing for Folding@Home. This
            means about 256 threads of raw performance.
            <br><br>
            To everyone else at home, from us at Suzzi we wish you safety for you and your loved ones
