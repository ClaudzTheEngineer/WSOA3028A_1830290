            In light of the current pandemic, any teaching that is continuing has been moved to online means. This can
            cause many issues for learners who are not used to online learning. A big sticking point is trying to cater
            to all forms of learning (visual, auditory and kinematic), as well as being considerate of those that do not
            have consistent, high-bandwidth connectivity. Personally, I am an auditory learner as such the following
            will be catering towards that demographic primarily<br>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Auditory Learning
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Podcasts
        </h3>
        <p>
            Auditory learning can lend itself to low bandwith communication quite easily, as the primary focus would be
            to hear the lecturer or teacher. Podcasts are a good medium for this as they can be uploaded to a single
            repository and downloaded when possible. Podcasts also allow for multitasking while listening (such as
            driving, cooking etc). This medium however loses the interactive element of a lecture where the
            learner could ask questions or provide comments. As such this style would be better for information dumps,
            with an interactive medium as an after the fact for questions and comments.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Group audio call
        </h3>
        <p>
            For those who would need a more realtime solution, audio conferencing is a potential
            solution. Audio conferencing (such as using discord, zoom etc) would allow the instructor and learner
            instantanious communication and the ability to directly engage with each other. This approach, although
            better
            than video conferencing, can be a bandwith hog if not regulated.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Internet Radio
        </h3>
        <p>
            For those that would need a good hybrid of the two, some form of internet radio with a live chatroom may be
            ideal. A standard HD audio stream is 128kbps and this can be lower if necessary. This means a 2 hour lecture
            would only consume around 58 MB of data at most. The chatroom does sacrifice clarity to some extent, as
            typing a question is slower than just saying it, and can be interpreted incorrectly.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            Although these solutions would work for someone with similar learning habits to me, the above assumes that a
            primarily audio focus, teaching would be further improved by utilising things like
            video and slide shows.
