            In these uncertain times, I wanna break this with something different. What can we offer one another to help
            each other? As a tech company, we have been working from home and are familiar with the tech out there,
            This time has proven to be a challenging time for everyone, especially those less fortunate. The biggest
            issue found to be plaguing me and my colleagues has been loss of motivation and work ethic. Whereby we’d
            spend hours staring at blank computer screens and getting no work done. This video was shared around the
            workplace. And encouraged good work life and home life balance. Perhaps it could help you, the reader, too.

            In a continued effort to assist our local community, we at Suzzi Inc have decided to offer a discount on IT
            solutions and integration for small to medium sized businesses, to assist businesses that are struggling to
            make the jump to online only work.
            <br><br>
            Though we are doing fine, we are 6 paces away from struggle, but this doesn’t stop us from helping our
            community because we are all in the same boat. Suzzi Inc. has also bought a few thousand masks and
            distributed them amongst the local community. The folding@home initiative has been going great,
            <br><br>
            On a more personal note, me and my wife have been doing grocery runs for a few of the elderly people in our
            neighbourhood, especially those who cannot leave due to risk or otherwise. Every little bit helps.
            <br><br>
            To our readers, and to their loved ones - we wish you safety
            <br><br>
