            When the sun is too bright, you will (probably) not launch a massive sunshade into space so that its less
            bright, you’d create sunglasses. Not every problem requires an overboard solution, but where is that
            dividing line? At what point is a solution overly engineered?
            <br><br>
            Let’s use a less ridiculous example, soap dispensers. You get two types of soap dispensers, “manual” and
            “automatic”. Although manual dispensers are genereally cheaper and easier to use, they can cause
            cross-contamination, hence the urge to move towards automatic units. Depending on the technology used within
            the unit various issues can arise, some unexpected. A few years ago a video went viral of a soap dispenser
            that would dispense soap for those that had lighter skin while not for those with darker skin. This was due
            to the usage of near-infared sensors and lights which respond differently to darker objects (namely skin).
            Poor planning and testing caused this product to come to market, however there are two ways forward from
            this issue, either more expensive and complicated detection methods could be employed (like ultrasonic range
            detectors) or move back to the simpler solution of manual dispensers. Where do we draw the line and say that
            more technology is bad?
            <br><br>
            On a related note, traffic lights. In recent decades, with LED technologies getting cheaper and more
            widespread, traffic lights across the USA were replaced with LED fixtures due to the mirade of benefits they
            provided. From using a tenth the energy to lasting far longer and providing feasible options for battery
            backups. However there was an issue, due to LED bulbs not wasting a lot of their energy as heat, the units
            would not stay warm. This meant during snowstorms ice and snow could build up on the surface of the bulb.
            Thus meaning that people would have accidents in these conditions. This caused outrage, with people claiming
            that this problem negated all the benefits that the LEDs brought to the table because of the “but
            sometimes”. In this situation, it is arguable that innovating on top of the LED technology (by including a
            heating element to heat the lens if it gets too cold) is a far better solution than to revert back to
            incandescent bulbs. However solutions aren’t always as clear cut and when lives are stake (directly or
            indirectly) more caution should be taken.
            <br><br>
            With the examples shown above, the usage of technology to “improve” peoples lives can be argued either way.
            However, companies and manufactures should be more responsible with the technology they create. There are
            many starry-eyed entrepreneurs with ideas they believe will make the world a better place, without realising
            the harm they may do due to their ignorance. This ignorance can manifest itself in many different situations
            and stages of production. The research phase, marketing phase or testing phase could all attribute to
            errors. Having the discipline and awareness to prevent these issues before we create products that help
            perpetuate long standing issues and/or biases is key.
            <br><br>
            Theres a time and place for optimisation, trying to find when its time to take a step back from these
            solutions and try find a more elegant solution is key.
