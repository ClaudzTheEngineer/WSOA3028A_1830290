        <h2>Early life and Career</h2>
        <p>
            I am Giovanni Suzzi a 54 year old man, born and raised on the outskirts of Trieste in the Fruili-Venezia
            Giula region. Born on the 24th of May 1966.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 18,I joined the Italian armed forces (Forze Armate Italine) in which I served for 4 years in the
            infantry. I rose to the rank of Caporale maggiore (platoon leader) during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had found out about better prospects in the southern african mercenary industry, giving me an opportunity
            to uproot and move down to the South Africa during the later stages of the South African Border war. Shortly
            after I joined as a mercenary, the company was dissolved due to the ending of the war in which they had been
            primarily participating. This left me stranded halfway across the world with few meaningful contacts and the
            small amount of money I had had in reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time I met the love of my life, Kaybi, who helped me redirect and focus his life. And without
            her I would never have found my footing again.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began exploring the various industries in South Africa, eventually
            settling into the Computer Industry around 2000 (all thanks to Kaybi), where I have been ever since.
            Primarily working
            backend-developmental software engineering jobs. My military background helping me land jobs, from my
            discipline allowing me to work harder than the average person, to incredible leadership skills. However,
            my regimented mindset made it difficult to adapt to change on grand scales, this Kaybi has had to help a lot
            with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I went on to produce my own software engineering company in the Summer of 2015(Suzzi Inc. Ltd.)
            and I have recently began experimenting with web development. The result of this expansion is the website
            you're currently reading.
