        <h2>Early life and Career</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Giovanni Suzzi, born and raised on the outskirts of Trieste in the Fruili-Venezia Giula region. I
            was born on the 24th of May 1966 - I am 54.
        </p>
        <p>
            Above, I have put an image of me, holding a Browning Machine gun shortly after joining the Italian armed
            forces (Forze Armate Italine) in which I served for 4 years in the infantry. I rose to the rank of Caporale
            maggiore (platoon leader) during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had discovered better prospects in the Southern African mercenary industry which gave me an opportunity to
            uproot and move down to South Africa during the later stages of the South African Border war. Unfortunately,
            shortly after I joined as a mercenary, the company was dissolved since the war in which they had been
            primarily participating had ended. This left me stranded halfway across the world with few meaningful
            contacts and only the small amount of money I had in reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time I met the love of my life, Kaybi, who helped me redirect and focus my life, without
            her I would never have found my footing again.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began exploring the various industries in South Africa, eventually settling into the Computer Industry
            around 2000 (all thanks to Kaybi). I have been there ever since. I primarily worked backend-developmental
            software engineering jobs. My military background helped me land jobs, from my discipline allowing me to
            work harder than the average person, to incredible leadership skills. However, my regimented mindset made it
            difficult to adapt to change on grand scales, this Kaybi has had to help a lot with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I went on to produce my own software engineering company in the Summer of 2015(Suzzi Inc. Ltd.)
            and I have recently began experimenting with web development. The result of this expansion is the website
            you're currently reading.
