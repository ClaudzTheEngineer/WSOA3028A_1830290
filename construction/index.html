            Color Scheme
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Proposed main color scheme for the website, this was chosen due to the clean aesthetic which it could
            provide with the light and dark greys, with the bright orange accent. The cleanliness would originate from
            the Giovanni's military background, where being tidy is of the upmost importance, while the orange would be
            to capture the readers attention.

        <h3>
            Data structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            The final website will consist of some form of database-esque storage system, into which all the various
            blog posts will be stored. Then a singular blog template page is stored and then backfilled using
            information from the database. This is appropriate from the perspective of Giovanni being skilled with
            backend development and would feel comfortable with this style of data manipulation.

        <h3>
            The Character - Giovanni Suzzi
        </h3>
        <p>
            This character is meant to be an amalgamation of my father and my grandfather. Combining the military
            aspects of the former and the engineering industriousness of the latter, as well as some elements of their
            lives. The history of the character is in the <a href=../about/index.html>about</a> page.

            Overhaul
        </h2>
        <p>
            A decision was made to overhaul the design of the website as a whole, as I started getting bogged down with
            trying too many things at once. As such the site has been rewritten from the ground up and the styling has
            been reimagined to better capture a more professional web developer.
            </br>
            The colour palette was changed to be a more calming set of colours as can be seen below. The previous style
            was overly saturated on reflection.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mobile oriented menu was removed due to the bodged implementation and new focus on creating a more
            desktop focused webpage. A mobile version may come later, this is discussed below.

            Logo
        </h3>
        <p>
            A logo to represent the company Giovanni had created was introduced as well as a tagline, both shown below.
            The tagline is meant to capture the fact that Giovanni had a history with warfare. The logo utilises a clean
            look with sharp straight lines indicative of military style.

            Blog List generation.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I had attempted to have the cards on the <a href=../blogs/index.html>blog index</a> page be automatically
            generated from javascript. Alithough i was able to make it generate the links using a predictable naming
            structure and a for loop ( &quot;blog&quot;+i). The problem came when trying to generate the content for the
            cards to display (image, title and short summary) as javascript cannot access files without using a server
            side program (like Node.js) or using php, Github pages also does not support server side programs and as
            such this idea was bust. Cards are entered manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            I gave this another bash and managed to find a workaround, by creating an array of objects containing the
            information needed for each card (the title, subtext, image link, blog link etc), I can then easily
            manipulate the generated cards in javascript and provide more flexibility. Using this i created a basic page
            system for the blog index.
            <br><br>
            To improve this system I implemented a system that reads the blog information from a .json file. This
            decouples the information about the page from the javascript.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Responsive design
        </h3>
        <p>
            Due to me developing on desktop, I had neglected the experience for mobile and tablet users, as such I
            redesigned the interface such that the page now automatically rescales accordingly. The blog index now
            scales accordingly to the relative width of the device it is being viewed on.

            To ease navigation to the latest blog posts, a dropdown menu was created to show the 6 latest blogposts.
