            The internet is meant to be the great equaliser. Where everyone is equal, and the prejudice of the real
            world is gone. However, one of the major limiting factors is the devices through which we access the
            internet because of the necessity for an internet connection and devices, not everyone has the same level of
            access globally. Even though the original intention was good, cracks have formed, this is known as the
            digital divide. But its more than just access, it extends to the understanding and the creation of content
            on the internet.
            <br><br>
            The digital divide appears in multiple ways; in how certain areas of the world cannot afford internet
            connections, where certain age groups cannot understand the how these systems work, or even just entire
            areas being restricted from their access. For instance, there are areas of Africa where for a yearly
            subscription to broadband internet costs more than the average yearly salary, up to 50 times as much!
            <br><br>
            There are numerous factors that could affect these performance metrics. Far too many to list in their
            entirety. As such I will be speculating why these problems perpetuate themselves.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>1. The Internet was created in English speaking country for those people</h2>
        <p>
            The primary language used on the internet is English, without question. W3Techs estimated the proportion of
            languages used in the top 10 million websites to be 59.6% English, with the second most being Russian with
            8.6%. This probably came from the fact that the internet was created in an English-speaking country for an
            English-Speaking country. This causes the platform to far more friendly towards English speaking users and
            dissuading other language users.
            <br><br>
            This is also visible in the actual framework of the internet. Most coding languages used are English
            based, using the Latin alphabet and English words (like for, if, while etc). This makes it far harder for
            non-native English speakers to learn to code as they must use words or even characters, they are not
            familiar with.
            <br><br>
            Strangely enough, even though a lot of English based programming languages are used, some weren’t created in
            English speaking territories, like Ruby is from Japan, Lua from Brazil and Python from the Netherlands. In
            these
            cases, the choice of a foreign language being used for the coding was due to wanting to appeal to an
            international audience. This helps perpetuate the use of English almost exclusively. English has become the
            international language of code, it's too late to change it, so nobody does.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Other countries joined in later, they had less time to create content.</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re in South Africa accessing a website in the united states, its not like you must go outside get a
            compass and point to the USA to get signal, in general internet access is all or nothing. If you’re in range
            of a tower, the location of a website doesn’t matter. (There are cases where proximity to the server
            matters, like gaming, but this is more a time factor over a product quality factor) As such you as a
            consumer would want to use the best services on the internet, regardless of location. However, this causes
            the side-effect of the largest and best websites (usually US based) growing larger and reinforces their
            monopoly.
            <br><br>
            For example, there are other online video-streaming services besides YouTube, but because YouTube has more
            users, more content creators, better monetisation among other reasons, people gravitate to this platform
            even with all the controversy surrounding it. For instance, one of the largest YouTuber’s, PewDiePie,
            probably chose YouTube as it was the largest platform at the time and still is. Even though the platform
            “Dailymotion” based in France was more localised to him.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Good things attract good people</h2>
        <P>
            Biases reinforce biases. When there is some form of hierarchy with regards to job opportunities, generally
            people will want to climb the ladder. As it currently stands Europe and the US have the
            best prospects when it comes to coding jobs, and as such would attract the best talent regardless of their
            origin.
            Combine this with companies in theses countries poaching the best talent from around the world and you get a
            situation where the best gets better and the worst get worse. These people aren’t necessarily self-serving.
            <br><br>
            The general populous have foresight. In general, they want the best for people they love; thus, people fear
            capping their success. They don’t want pay-as-you-go success they want uncapped success. The
            telemarketer in your head is always urging you to upgrade. And as such the best amongst us will move to
            where they can fully develop themselves.
            <br><br>
            So, is it even possible or worth it to bridge the gap created by the digital divide, will it always be a
            divide by zero? I guess we’ll find out.
